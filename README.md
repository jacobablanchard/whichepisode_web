## Ever wanted to watch a show, but just wanted to pick a random episode to watch?

This app is for you! Using themoviedb.org's api, this app will provide you a list of shows to choose from and search for. Once selected, you can click the 'Get me an episode!' button to randomly generate an episode to watch! (Note: Episodes from Season 0 of a show are typically extra deleted scenes or specials that don't really belong to a season)
